# 🧠 Obsidian Recall

### An AI-powered Copilot that lives inside your Obsidian vault.

**Chat with your notes. Generate flashcards. Summarize topics. All locally.**



</div>

---

## 📖 What is this?

**Obsidian Recall** turns your static Markdown notes into a living, queryable knowledge base — directly inside Obsidian's sidebar. Point it at your vault, sync once, and you can:

- **Ask questions** about anything you've ever written
- **Summarize** entire files or broad topics with one command
- **Generate flashcards** from technical notes for active recall
- **Find files** by describing what's in them, not by remembering the name

It runs **100% locally** — your notes never leave your machine. The only external call is to the Cohere API for embeddings.

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed before you begin:

- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) with Gemma 2B pulled
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for building the Obsidian plugin)
- An active [Cohere API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.com/)

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HilalAhmad01/Obsidian-Recall.git
cd Obsidian-Recall
```

### Step 2 — Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 — Pull the LLM via Ollama

```bash
ollama pull gemma2:2b
```

### Step 4 — Configure Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```env
COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_api_key_here
```

### Step 5 — Set Your Vault Path

Open `main.py` and `server.py` and update the vault path to point to your Obsidian notes folder:

```python
# In main.py and server.py, find this line and update it:
vault_path = "/your/path/to/Notes"   # ← change this
```

### Step 6 — Build & Install the Obsidian Plugin

Copy `main.ts` (compiled to `main.js`) into your vault's plugin folder:

```
YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-recall/main.js
```

Then go to **Obsidian → Settings → Community Plugins** and enable **Obsidian Recall**.

### Step 7 — Start the Server

```bash
python server.py
```

The API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Step 8 — Sync Your Vault

Click the **🔄 Sync** button in the Obsidian sidebar to index your notes for the first time. This only needs to run fully once — future syncs are incremental.

## 💬 Commands Reference

Open the **Vault Copilot** panel from the left ribbon (🤖 icon) and use these commands:

| Command | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/list` | `/list` | Lists every Markdown file currently indexed in the vector store. |
| `/find` | `/find mlops architecture` | Semantically searches for files matching a description. |
| `/summarize_file` | `/summarize_file Biology.md` | Summarizes a single specific file from your vault. |
| `/summarize` | `/summarize Neural Networks` | Synthesizes notes on a topic across your entire vault. |
| `/flashcards` | `/flashcards OS_Notes.md` | Generates 5 study flashcards from the specified file. |
| **Chat** | `What is backpropagation?` | Any non-command text triggers a full RAG chat query. |

> **Tip:** Click the `/list`, `/summarize`, or `/flashcards` hint chips at the bottom of the panel to auto-fill the command prefix.

## 🔌 API Endpoints

If you want to interact with the backend directly (e.g., for scripting or testing):

| Method | Endpoint | Payload | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/sync` | — | Re-scans vault and indexes new files |
| `GET` | `/list` | — | Returns all indexed filenames |
| `POST` | `/chat` | `{ "message": "..." }` | General RAG chat |
| `POST` | `/summarize` | `{ "topic": "..." }` | Topic-based summarization |
| `POST` | `/summarize_file` | `{ "filename": "..." }` | Single-file summarization |
| `POST` | `/flashcards` | `{ "filename": "..." }` | Flashcard generation |
| `POST` | `/find-notes` | `{ "topic": "..." }` | Semantic file search |

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
Your .md files
      │
      ▼
MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter   ← splits on #, ##, ###
      │
      ▼
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter  ← 512 tokens, 60 overlap
      │
      ▼
Cohere embed-v4.0            ← generates dense vectors
      │
      ▼
ChromaDB (cosine similarity) ← persisted to ./chroma_db
      │
      ▼
Query → Retrieve top-k chunks → LangChain Chain → Gemma 2B → Response
```

On every sync, only **new files** are embedded — existing ones are skipped. This keeps your Cohere API usage minimal.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Delete/re-index individual files from the UI
- [ ] Support for PDF and web clip ingestion
- [ ] Streaming responses in the sidebar
- [ ] Spaced repetition tracker for flashcards
- [ ] Multi-vault support
- [ ] Local embeddings option (eliminate Cohere dependency)

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Here's how to get started:

```bash
# 1. Fork the repo and clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Obsidian-Recall.git

# 2. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make your changes and commit
git commit -m "feat: add your feature"

# 4. Push and open a Pull Request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Please open an issue first for major changes so we can discuss the approach.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- The LLM (Gemma 2B) is small and fast, but may hallucinate on complex reasoning. Always verify important answers against your actual notes.
- First-time indexing of large vaults may take several minutes depending on the number of files and your Cohere API tier.
- The plugin currently requires `server.py` to be running manually before use.
